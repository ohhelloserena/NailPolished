# NailStash

NailStash is an Android app that allows users to search for nail polish swatches (photos of nail polish painted on fingers) by 
scanning product's barcode. 

It's common to Google swatch photos when buying nail polish in stores. This app automates that process.

## Built With

* Java
* Google Vision Barcode API
* UPC Item DB API
* Google Custom Search JSON API

## Features

* Barcode scanner for UP-C and UP-E barcodes
* Google Image Search for product photos for the given barcode

## TODO

* Find a UPC API that has a higher request limit
* Create an API so scanned products can be added to the user's wishlist or collection (to keep track of user's nail polish inventory)
